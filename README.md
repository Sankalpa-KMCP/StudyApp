## Core Premise: Local-First & Offline

- **Zero Cloud Dependency:** All data stays in IndexedDB on your device.
- **Absolute Privacy:** No telemetry, tracking, or remote APIs.
- **Self-Contained:** Runs entirely in the browser or as a Tauri desktop app.

---

## Features

### Refined glass UI
- Frosted panels with shared `Card`, `Button`, and `ModalShell` primitives
- Theme opacity and blur sliders in Control Deck affect all glass cards in real time
- Per-theme page gradients and consistent 11–12px minimum label typography

### Focus Engine
- Configurable study block, short break, and long break durations
- Pomodoro cycle tracking with optional zen lockout during study
- Session reflection with attention/stability ratings
- Interrupted session recovery via `sessionStorage` heartbeat
- Screen wake lock during active study blocks

### Task Registry
- Priority-sorted tasks with cycle estimates
- SM-2 spaced repetition for study subjects
- Subtasks and auto-archive of completed tasks (90+ days)

### Recall Deck
- Flashcards with SM-2 scheduling
- Category filters and grade tracking

### Analytics Studio
- Weekly charts, category breakdown, retention curves
- Streak and XP leveling from study minutes

### Activity Ledger
- Calendar heatmap and daily mood/notes journal
- Per-day session history

### Control Deck
- Theme, opacity, blur, timer, sound, font, and backup settings
- Export/import `.studybackup` vault files and CSV reports

## Audio

The app plays **short session chimes** when blocks complete (toggle in Settings). Ambient soundscapes are not included in this build.

---

## Timer Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `dailyGoalMinutes` | 480 | Daily study target |
| `studyBlockDurationMinutes` | 25 | Focus block length |
| `shortBreakDurationMinutes` | 5 | Short break length |
| `longBreakDurationMinutes` | 15 | Long break length |
| `targetSessionsPerCycle` | 4 | Study sessions before long break |

---

## Data Model

- **History entries** include `createdAt` (epoch ms) for reliable date filtering, plus a human-readable `timestamp` for display.
- **Emergency snapshots** are stored in IndexedDB (`snapshots` table), keeping the last 3 automatic backups.
- **Schema version:** 7 (Dexie `db.verno` — IndexedDB migration version).
- **Backup `version: 2`** in `.studybackup` JSON exports is the **export file format** revision — separate from the DB schema version above.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.

### Data limits

| Limit | Value | Used by |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Recent history window | 100 entries | Analytics (`useRecentHistory`) |
| Journal history | Current calendar month | `useHistoryForMonth` |
| Full history table | Unbounded | Backup export only (`db.history.toArray`) |
| Auto snapshots retained | 3 | `useSessionBackup` |
| Shadow restore threshold | ≥ 60s elapsed | `useTimerEngine` sessionStorage heartbeat |
| Reflection notes max | 500 chars | Activity ledger / reflection modal |

---

## Architecture

Data hooks live in [`src/db/hooks/`](src/db/hooks/) (repositories + per-domain hooks). Full diagrams and context tree: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev            # Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build          # Production build to dist/
npm test               # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:coverage  # Coverage gate (80% lines, 65% branches)
npm run test:coverage:components  # Shared/analytics component gate (50%)
npm run check:bundle   # Gzip budget on main chunk (~512 KB)
npm run test:watch     # Vitest watch mode
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright user journeys
npm run storybook      # Component stories on port 6006
npm run build-storybook
npm run lint           # ESLint + jsx-a11y
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for migrations, settings, and E2E conventions.

### Testing guide

| Layer | Command | Location |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Unit / hooks | `npm test` | `src/lib/__tests__`, `src/db/__tests__`, `src/hooks/__tests__` |
| Component | `npm test` | `src/components/**/__tests__` |
| Context / integration | `npm test` | `src/context/__tests__` |
| Coverage gate | `npm run test:coverage` | 80% lines / 65% branches on scoped modules |
| Component gate | `npm run test:coverage:components` | 50% on shared primitives and analytics |
| E2E | `npm run test:e2e` | `e2e/` including analytics, journal, zen, mobile, invalid backup |
| Storybook + a11y | `npm run storybook` | `@storybook/addon-a11y` on all stories |

### Tauri Desktop App

```bash
npm run tauri:dev    # Desktop dev with hot reload
npm run tauri:build  # Build native installer
```

Push a version tag (`v*`, e.g. `v1.0.0`) to trigger the Tauri release build workflow (`.github/workflows/tauri-release.yml`).

---

## PWA Install

The app includes a web manifest and service worker (`vite-plugin-pwa`) for offline app-shell caching. The service worker precaches the app shell; IndexedDB is the source of truth (no remote API). An offline banner appears when the network is unavailable. Deploy to GitHub Pages or any static host.

---

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

Pushes to `master` or `V2` trigger automatic deployment via `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

Base path: `/StudyApp/` (configured in `vite.config.ts`).

**One-time repo setup (required):** In GitHub → Settings → Pages → Build and deployment, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (not “Deploy from a branch”). Without this, `deploy-pages` fails with `401 Requires authentication`.

**Actions permissions:** Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → **Read and write permissions**.
